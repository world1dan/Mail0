## What is Mail0.io?

Mail0.io is an open-source email solution that gives users the power to **self-host** their own email app while also integrating external services like Gmail and other email providers. Our goal is to put **control, privacy, and customization** back into the hands of users‚Äîwhether they choose to host their email independently or manage multiple inboxes from a single, customizable platform.

## Why Mail0.io?

Most email services today are either **closed-source**, **data-hungry**, or **too complex to self-host**. Mail0.io is different:

‚úÖ **Fully Open-Source** ‚Äì No hidden agendas, no walled gardens. 100% transparency.
üîí **Data Privacy First** ‚Äì Your emails, your data. No tracking, no selling, no middlemen.
‚öôÔ∏è **Self-Hosting Freedom** ‚Äì Run your own email app with ease.
üì¨ **Unified Inbox** ‚Äì Connect multiple email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and more.
üé® **Customizable UI & Features** ‚Äì Tailor your email experience the way you want it.
üöÄ **Developer-Friendly** ‚Äì Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.

## Our Mission

We believe email should be:

1. **Yours** ‚Äì You control where your data is stored.
2. **Flexible** ‚Äì Use it however you want‚Äîself-hosted or connected to third-party providers.
3. **Open** ‚Äì Transparent development, open collaboration, and community-driven innovation.
4. **User-Friendly** ‚Äì No need for technical expertise to get started.

## Tech Stack

Mail0.io is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Better Auth, Google OAuth
<!-- - **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Required Versions:**

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- Docker >= 20.10.0

Before running the application, you'll need to set up several services and environment variables:

1. **Setup Local Services with Dev Container and Docker**

   - Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.
   - Open codebase as a container in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favorite VSCode fork.
   - Run the following commands in order to populate your dependencies and setup docker

     ```
     pnpm install
     pnpm docker:up
     ```

   - Run the following commands to clean up after yourself

     ```
     pnpm docker:down
     rm -rf node_modules
     rm pnpm-lock.yaml
     ```

   - Run the following commands if you are unable to start any of the services

     ```
     rm -rf node_modules
     rm pnpm-lock.yaml
     ```

2. **Better Auth Setup**

   - Open `.env` and change the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to a random string. (Use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a 32 character string)

     ```env
     BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
     ```

3. **Google OAuth Setup**

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

   - Add the following APIs to your Google Cloud Project: [People API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com), [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com)
     - Use links above and click 'Enable' or
     - Go to 'APIs and Services' > 'Enable APIs and Services' > Search for 'Google People API' and click 'Enable'
     - Go to 'APIs and Services' > 'Enable APIs and Services' > Search for 'Gmail API' and click 'Enable'
   - Enable the Google OAuth2 API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application type)
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - Development:
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
       - `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback`
     - Production:
       - `https://your-production-url/api/auth/callback/google`

     GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mail/auth/google/callback
     ```

   - Add yourself as a test user:

     - Goto [`Audience`](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience)
     - Under 'Test users' click 'Add Users'
     - Add your email and click 'Save'

> [!WARNING]
> The `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` must match **exactly** what you configure in the Google Cloud Console, including the protocol (http/https), domain, and path - these are provided above.

4. **Microsoft OAuth Setup**
